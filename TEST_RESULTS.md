# Secure Purchase Order System - Test Results

## 1. Public-Key Mutual Authentication

### Test Case 1.1: User Login Authentication
- **Description**: Verify that users can only access the system with valid credentials
- **Steps**:
  1. Attempt login with invalid credentials
  2. Attempt login with valid credentials
  3. Verify session management
- **Expected Results**: 
  - Invalid credentials should be rejected
  - Valid credentials should grant access
  - Session should be maintained securely
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ Invalid credentials rejected
  - ✅ Valid credentials accepted
  - ✅ Session maintained with JWT tokens

### Test Case 1.2: Role-Based Access Control
- **Description**: Verify that users can only access features appropriate to their role
- **Steps**:
  1. Login as Purchaser
  2. Login as Supervisor
  3. Login as Purchasing Department
- **Expected Results**:
  - Purchaser: Can create and sign orders
  - Supervisor: Can approve/reject orders
  - Purchasing: Can process approved orders
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ Role-based access working as expected
  - ✅ Each role has appropriate permissions

## 2. Digital Signatures and Hash Verification

### Test Case 2.1: Purchase Order Signing
- **Description**: Verify the digital signature process
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a new purchase order
  2. Sign the order as purchaser
  3. Verify signature in database
- **Expected Results**:
  - Order should be signed with timestamp
  - Signature should be stored securely
  - Hash should be verifiable
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ Signatures created successfully
  - ✅ Timestamps recorded
  - ✅ Signatures stored in database

### Test Case 2.2: Signature Verification
- **Description**: Verify that signatures can be validated
- **Steps**:
  1. Create and sign an order
  2. Attempt to modify the order
  3. Verify signature becomes invalid
- **Expected Results**:
  - Original signature should be valid
  - Modified order should show invalid signature
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ Signature validation working
  - ✅ Tampering detection functional

## 3. Timestamp Verification

### Test Case 3.1: Timestamp Accuracy
- **Description**: Verify timestamp accuracy and format
- **Steps**:
  1. Create and sign multiple orders
  2. Verify timestamps are sequential
  3. Check timestamp format
- **Expected Results**:
  - Timestamps should be accurate
  - Format should be consistent
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ Timestamps accurate
  - ✅ Format consistent

## 4. Cross-checking of Signatures

### Test Case 4.1: Multi-party Signature Verification
- **Description**: Verify signature chain from purchaser to supervisor
- **Steps**:
  1. Create order as purchaser
  2. Sign as purchaser
  3. Approve and sign as supervisor
  4. Verify both signatures
- **Expected Results**:
  - Both signatures should be valid
  - Chain of custody should be clear
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ Signature chain verified
  - ✅ Chain of custody maintained

## 5. Message Encryption

### Test Case 5.1: Data Transmission Security
- **Description**: Verify data encryption in transit
- **Steps**:
  1. Monitor network traffic
  2. Verify HTTPS usage
  3. Check payload encryption
- **Expected Results**:
  - All traffic should be encrypted
  - No sensitive data in plaintext
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ HTTPS enforced
  - ✅ Payloads encrypted

## 6. Complete Workflow Testing

### Test Case 6.1: End-to-End Process
- **Description**: Test complete purchase order workflow
- **Steps**:
  1. Create order as purchaser
  2. Sign as purchaser
  3. Approve as supervisor
  4. Process as purchasing department
- **Expected Results**:
  - All steps should complete successfully
  - Audit trail should be maintained
  - Signatures should be preserved
- **Actual Results**:
  - ✅ Workflow completed successfully
  - ✅ Audit trail maintained
  - ✅ Signatures preserved

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Management**
   - Private keys stored securely
   - No key exposure in logs or responses
   - Proper key rotation support

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions enforced
   - Session management secure
   - No unauthorized access

3. **Data Integrity**
   - Signatures verify data integrity
   - Timestamps prevent replay attacks
   - Audit trail maintained

4. **Non-repudiation**
   - Digital signatures provide proof
   - Timestamps establish sequence
   - Audit logs track all actions

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Key Management**
   - Implement proper key rotation
   - Use hardware security modules
   - Regular key backup

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement 2FA
   - Regular session timeout
   - IP-based restrictions

3. **Monitoring**
   - Implement SIEM
   - Regular security audits
   - Automated threat detection

4. **Compliance**
   - Regular security assessments
   - Documentation updates
   - Training programs
